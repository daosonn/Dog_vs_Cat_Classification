# Dog_vs_Cat_Classification
This repository contains the scripts and configuration files needed to train a YOLOv8 model to classify images of cats and dogs using a dataset of over 10,000 images.

## Project Overview

1. **Dataset Preparation**: The dataset consists of more than 10,000 images of cats and dogs. For YOLOv8, each image needs an associated `.txt` file that specifies the bounding box coordinates and class labels.
2. **Data Splitting**: The dataset is split into training and validation sets.
3. **Model Training**: The YOLOv8 model is trained using the prepared dataset.
